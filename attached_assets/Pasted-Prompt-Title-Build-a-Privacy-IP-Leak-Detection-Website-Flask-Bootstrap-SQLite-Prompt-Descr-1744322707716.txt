Prompt Title:
Build a Privacy & IP Leak Detection Website (Flask + Bootstrap + SQLite)

Prompt Description:
I want to create a Flask-based website (similar to Whoer.net or ipleak.net) that tests privacy and anonymity for users using proxies/VPNs. The goal is to check for IP leaks, fingerprint leaks, and general traceability, and provide a detailed fraud risk score before accessing sensitive services like PayPal.

Tech Stack:
	•	Backend: Python (Flask)
	•	Frontend: HTML + Bootstrap (for styling and responsive layout)
	•	Database: SQLite (store logs of checks, user sessions, fraud scores, etc.)
	•	Client-side JS: For browser-based fingerprinting, WebRTC, etc.

⸻

Core Features:

1. IP & Location Info
	•	Public IP (IPv4/IPv6)
	•	City, region, country, timezone
	•	ISP and ASN info
	•	Reverse DNS lookup
	•	Hostname, connection type (residential, business, datacenter)
	•	Integration with IP location API (e.g., ipapi.co, ipinfo.io)

2. VPN / Proxy / Tor Detection
	•	Detect if a VPN or proxy is used
	•	Flag known VPN or datacenter IPs
	•	Tor exit node detection
	•	Transparent or anonymous proxy detection
	•	Show proxy headers like X-Forwarded-For, Via, etc.

3. WebRTC Leak Test
	•	Get local and public IPs via WebRTC (JavaScript)
	•	Flag local IPs that leak internal network structure

4. DNS Leak Test
	•	Detect all DNS servers
	•	Compare DNS server geolocation to IP geolocation
	•	Log DNS resolvers that don’t match IP country

5. JavaScript Fingerprinting
	•	Gather:
	•	User-Agent
	•	OS and browser info
	•	Timezone and language
	•	Screen resolution, color depth
	•	Installed fonts
	•	Canvas fingerprint
	•	WebGL fingerprint
	•	AudioContext fingerprint
	•	Battery API
	•	Touch support
	•	Entropy-based uniqueness score (how unique is this fingerprint?)

6. HTTP Header Inspection
	•	Full list of request headers (browser sends)
	•	Highlight suspicious or non-standard headers

7. Blacklist & Fraud Check
	•	Check if IP is listed in:
	•	Spamhaus
	•	Project Honey Pot
	•	AbuseIPDB
	•	Flag risky ASNs known for abuse
	•	Fraud score calculation: 0–100 with color code (green/yellow/red)

8. Anonymity / Risk Report
	•	Progress bar while scanning
	•	Final anonymity score (based on IP + fingerprint + DNS + headers + blacklist)
	•	Risk level summary: Safe / Medium Risk / High Risk
	•	Optional PDF or downloadable JSON summary

9. User Sessions & History (via SQLite)
	•	Store test results linked to session ID or timestamp
	•	Allow user to view history of last X checks
	•	Log IP, test results, and fraud score
